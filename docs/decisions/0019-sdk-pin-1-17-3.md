# ADR-0019: SDK Pin 1.17.3

## Context
Auto-upgrading the MCP SDK from 1.17.3 to 1.27.0 broke auth middleware in the local MCP server. The newer version changed transport initialization and middleware hooks in a backward-incompatible way.

## Decision
Pin MCP SDK to version 1.17.3. Do not auto-upgrade. Review for upgrade in Phase 3 when auth middleware is stable and tested.

## Consequences
- ✅ Stable, working auth middleware
- ✅ Known behavior — no surprise breaking changes
- ⚠️ Missing features and fixes from newer SDK versions
- ⚠️ Must manually review and test before any future upgrade
